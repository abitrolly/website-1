### Feature highlights

Preflight checks for config-patches

### Breaking changes

- [Single Cluster Reference Architecture](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/self-hosted/latest/reference-architecture/single-cluster-ref-arch) changes:
  - Regular workspaces and headless workspaces are isolated to separate node pools to help avoid noisy neighbor issues between the two and guarantee maximum performance for worksapces
  - Workspace Services (such as `ws-manager`) are deployed to the services nodepool to prevent potential service degradation from high `ws-daemon` memory use.
  - We've increased the default node size to 16 core / 64 GB nodes. This is to allow for more workspaces per node, and avoid the scenario where there is just one workspace per node. We've also added [documentation](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/self-hosted/latest/configuring-workspace-resources) to detail our recommendations around workspace resources.

### Fixes and improvements
