### Highlights

#### Preflight checks on the Gitpod configuration

[#12015](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/12015) We know that some of you are using [config patches](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/self-hosted/latest/config-patches) to configure additional aspects of Gitpod, such as the resources that workspaces use. Up until now, there was no validation on these patches and thus it was difficult to debug if there was an issue with them. This has changed now - there is a preflight check that validates these (and the Gitpod configuration as a whole), and then informs you where to look to find any errors.

#### Additional safeguards during updates

[#13215](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/pull/13215) During updates, we recommend that you do not have any workspaces running to prevent data loss (see [update guide](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/self-hosted/latest/updating)). There is now a preflight check that checks for running workspaces before you deploy and fails if it finds any running ones. If an update is deployed anyways, running workspaces will be stopped for you. Note that users will see their workspaces stopped arbitrarily.

#### We've refactored large parts of the KOTS installation job

[#12196](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/12196) The KOTS installer script is used to generate a config file out of the values inserted into the KOTS UI. We've refactored large parts of it to turn it from a bash script into a part of the installer image. This improves reliability and predictability for you and maintainability for us. It also allows us to call this during preflight checks, enabling us to provide the preflight checks for config patches mentioned above.

### Breaking changes

- [Single Cluster Reference Architecture](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/self-hosted/latest/reference-architecture/single-cluster-ref-arch) changes:
  - Regular workspaces and headless workspaces are isolated to separate node pools to help avoid noisy neighbor issues between the two and guarantee maximum performance for workspaces
  - Workspace Services (such as `ws-manager`) are deployed to the services nodepool to prevent potential service degradation from high `ws-daemon` memory use.
  - We've increased the default node size to 16 core / 64 GB nodes. This is to allow for more workspaces per node, and avoid the scenario where there is just one workspace per node. We've also added [documentation](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/self-hosted/latest/configuring-workspace-resources) to detail our recommendations around workspace resources.
